  Thuy, in the plot below, if you do a count on region_continent, you get a tibble: 10 x 2 showing the first region_continent name is blank and has an n size = 738, a larger n size than all other rigion_continents combined. Perhaps you could drop the blank name and that would help make the output meaninful?
